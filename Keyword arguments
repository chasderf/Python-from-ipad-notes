You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax
This way the order of the arguments doesn’t matter

Def my_function (child3, child2, child1):
print(“The youngest child is “ + child3 )
My_function (child1 = “Emil”, child2 = “Tobias”, child3 = “Linus”)

The phrase keyword arguments are often shortened to kwargs in python documentations
