Python dates

A date in python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to
work with dates as date objects

Import datetime
X = datetime.datetime.now ( )
Print ( x )

Date output
When we execute the code form the example above the result will be

2022-9-9 23:14:42

The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond
The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date object
