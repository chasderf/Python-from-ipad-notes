Number of arguments

By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments, meaning that if your
function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more and not less

Def my_function (fname, lname):
print (fname + “ “ + lname )

My_function ( “Emil”, “Radoi” )
