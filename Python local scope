A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope

Local scope

A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function and can only be used
inside that funciton

Def myfunc( )
X = 300
Print ( x )

Myfunc( )

Function inside function

As explained in the example above, the variable x is not available outside the function, but it is
available for any function inside the function
