The format ( ) method allows you to format selected parts of a string
Sometimes there are parts of a text that you do not control, maybe they come from a database or
user input
To control such values, add placeholders (curly bracket {} ) in the text, and run the values through
the format ( ) method

//INPUT
Price = 49
Txt = “The price { } dollars “
Print ( txt.format(price) )
