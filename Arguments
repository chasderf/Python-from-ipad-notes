Information can be passed into function as arguments
Arguments are speciofied after the function name, inside the parentheses, you can add as many
arguments as you want, just speerate them with a comma
The following example has a function with one argument (fname) when the function is called, we
pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name

//INPUT
Def my_function(fname)
Print ( fname + “Seager”)
My_function ( “Emil”)
My_function (“Tobias”)
My_function (“Linus”)

// OUTPUTS::
Emil Seager
Tobias Seager
Linus Seager
