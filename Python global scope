A variable created in the main body of the python code is a global variable and belongs to the
gallbladder scope

Global variables are viable bl from within any scope, global and local

Basically a variable created outside of a function is global and can be used by anyone

X = 300
Def myfunc ( ):
Print ( x )

Myfunc ( )

Print ( x )

Global keyword
If you need to create a global variable, but are stuck in the local scope, you can use the global
keyword

The global keyword makes the variable global

//INPUT
Def myfunc ( )
Global x
X = 300

Myfunc ( )

Print ( x )

Also, use the global keyword if you want to make a change to a global variable inside a function
