If you don’t know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function add two
asterisks ** before the parameter name in the function defintion
This way the function will receive a dicitonary of arguments, and can access the items accordingly

Def my_function (**kid):
print(“His last name is “ + kid[ “ lname ”]
My_function(fname = “Tobias”, lname = “Radoi” )

Arbitrary kword arguments are often shortened to **kwargs in python documentations
