Python inheritance

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another
classs

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class

Create a parent class

Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

Use the super ( ) function

Python also has a super ( ) function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and
properties from its parent::

Class student(person)
Def _ init _ (self, fname, lname):

Super( ).__init_(fname, lname)

By using the super ( ) function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will
automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent
