A lambda function is a small anonymous function
A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression

Syntax
Lambda arguments : expression
The expression is executed and the result is returned

Add 10 to arguemnt a, and return the result:
X = lambda a : a + 10
Print(x(5))

Lambda functions can take any number of arguments
X = lambda a, b, c : a + b + c
Print (x(5,7,2) )
Why use lambda functions
The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another
function

Def myfunc(n)
Return lambda a :a * n
