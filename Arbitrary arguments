If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the
parameter name in the function defintion

This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly

Def my_function ( *kids )
print ( “The youngest child is “ + kids[2] )

My_function (“Emil”, “Tobias”, “Linus” )

Arbitrary arguments are often shortened to *args in python documentations
