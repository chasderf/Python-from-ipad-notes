Python is an oop language
Almost everything in python is an object, with its properties and methods

A class is like an object constructor or a blue print for creating objects

Create a class

To create a class use the keyword class:

Classs MyClass
X = 5

Creating a new object
Now we can use the class named myclass to create objects

P1 = MyClass( )
Print( p1.x)

The_init_( ) function

The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and aren’t really useful in real
life applications

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built in_init_( ) function

All classes have a function called _init_( ) which is always executed when the class is being initiated

Use the _init_( ) function to assign values to object properties or other operations that are
necessary to do when the object is being created

Class Person:
def_init(self, name, age):
self.name = name
self.age = age

P1 = person(“John”, 36)
Print ( p1.name )
Print ( p1.age )

Note: the _init__( ) function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create. New
object

Object methods

Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object

Let’s create a method in the person class

Class Person:
def _init_ (self, name, age):
self.name = name
self.age = age

def myfunc( self )
print(“Hello My Name is “ + self.name )

P1 = Person ( “John”, 36)
P1.myfunc( )

Note: the self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access
variables that belong to the class

The self parameter

The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is sued to access
variables that belongs to the class

It doesn’t have to be named self, you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first
parameter of any function in the class

Class Person:
def _init_ (sillybilly, name, age):
sillybilly.name = name
sillybilly.age = age

def myfunc ( sillybilly )
print(“Hello My Name is “ + self.name )

P1 = Person ( “John”, 36)

P1.myfunc( )

How to modify object properties

You can modify properties on objects like this

P1.age = 40

Delete objects properties

You can delete properties objectecs by using the del keyword
Del p1.age

The pass statement

Class definitions can’t be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content,
put it in the pass statement to avoid getting an error

Class person
Pass
